## Oregon Trail in TypeScript

### G4C Project for December 19th

In this project, a pair of Implementations and stubbed out Classes with instructions were provided to the students. 

The goal of the assignment was to create a working TypeScript Oregon Trail Game and print the output to the console.log.

This was our first TypeScript assignment.
